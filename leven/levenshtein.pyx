    When a and b are both byte strings (type bytes), the distance is computed
    bytewise. When a and b are both Unicode strings (type unicode in Python 2,
    str in Python 3), the distance is computed codepoint-wise.

    Other combinations of types will cause a TypeError to be raised.

    When passing Unicode strings, make sure they use the same normalized form
    (use the function unicodedata.normalize in the standard library).

    The normalize parameter can be used to normalize the distance by the length
    of the longest input.
